<h1><span class="title">Weekly Checklist Note Assignment</span></h1>


</div>

<main>


<p>Each week after lab, your assignment is to post a note on the group checklist (or one of the group&rsquo;s checklists; sometimes there will be more than one).</p>

<h3 id="set-up-you-only-need-to-do-this-once">Set up (you only need to do this once)</h3>

<p>Create an eBird account as soon as you can after our first lab. Go to the eBird main page  at <a href="https://ebird.org/">https://ebird.org/</a> and click on the “Get started” or “Create account” buttons to go to the new account page. I&rsquo;ve posted some discussion of what eBird is <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/posts/using-ebird/">here</a>. Then, email me your username, so I can add it to the list.</p>

<h3 id="make-notes-while-on-your-field-trip">Make notes while on your field trip</h3>

<p>Among the good topics for notes are: observed behaviors, descriptions of vocalizations heard, bird appearances and distinguishing features you saw, how they interacted with other species if any, how we ruled out related species, and habitats they were in. You will then add one of these notes to the group&rsquo;s list, as described below.</p>

<h3 id="accept-each-week-s-checklist-shared-with-you">Accept each week&rsquo;s checklist shared with you</h3>

<p>Shortly after lab, either I or the student who is the week&rsquo;s list-recorder will share the group list with you. You will see that it&rsquo;s shared with you either by receiving an email that says so (at the address you use for your eBird account) or by looking at <a href="https://ebird.org/shared">https://ebird.org/shared</a>. Accept the list into your account.</p>

<h3 id="go-to-the-notes-details-field-of-a-particular-species">Go to the notes/details field of a particular species</h3>

<p>On the shared checklist page (like <a href="https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S52496503">this one</a>, from our first trip to Jones Beach), click on the “<strong>Edit Species List</strong>” button. Scroll down to a species for which you want to add a note. Click the “<strong>Add Details</strong>” button.  The notes field says “<strong>Details:</strong>” next to it. Be careful not to delete anything that&rsquo;s already there.</p>

<h3 id="add-a-note-there">Add a note there</h3>

<p>The assignment is to add at least one note to the comments section of an observation.</p>

<p>The requirements for your checklist note are:</p>

<ul>
<li>It should begin with your initials and a colon (like “CE:” so we can recognize it’s yours).</li>
<li>It should be at least two sentences; it doesn’t need to be longer than that.</li>
<li>It should not duplicate the information in someone else’s note(s).</li>
<li>And it should be added to the eBird list within a week, before the next lab.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="example-notes">Example notes:</h4>

<p>on a Downy Woodpecker observation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CE: This very small woodpecker was working its way up the main trunk of an Oak. We ruled out Hairy Woodpecker by noticing small bill and black spots on outer tail feathers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>on a Peregrine Falcon observation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CE: We did not see this bird coming until it was nearly on top of a flock of Dunlin, which flew up. Having missed the Dunlin, it flew to a distant perch on a building&rsquo;s antenna.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="optional-additions-and-subtractions">Optional additions and subtractions</h3>

<p>Optionally, if you did not see all the same species the group saw, and you want to keep your records like the number of species you&rsquo;ve seen accurate for yourself, you can change the numbers on the list. Don&rsquo;t worry, these changes will <em>not</em> affect the group&rsquo;s list, only yours.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>If you have photos (or even audio?) of the birds we saw you can also add them to the checklist by editing a record, clicking on “media” and then dragging (<a href="https://help.ebird.org/customer/portal/articles/973966-adding-photos-videos-and-recordings-to-checklists">more instructions here</a>).</p>

<h3 id="questions-or-help">Questions or help?</h3>

<p>Of course, please feel free to ask! There are also a lot of helpful instructions at <a href="https://help.ebird.org">https://help.ebird.org</a>.</p>
