<h3 id="task">Task</h3>

<p>Observe birds independently for a cumulative 80 minutes minimum, and submit an eBird checklist (or checklists) documenting what you found.</p>

<h3 id="due">Due</h3>

<p>Email links to your checklist(s) to me by <strong>Monday May 13</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>

<p>Sometime during the semester, or several times, you should observe and count birds on your own outside of class for a combined minimum of 80 minutes.  It can be one continuous count, or as many as eight  different times and places. You can use eBird&rsquo;s stationary or traveling protocols, and you can be anywhere outdoorsâ€”hiking in the woods, or sitting on a bench at Hofstra, or visiting a city park, or wherever you like. One rewarding strategy is to visit the same place several times, weeks apart, and noting differences. I would just urge you to choose a place that will be enjoyable and interesting for you, as the goal is learning and experience, not busy-work.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re done, add the observations to eBird checklists. Use counts rather than X&rsquo;s. Then email URLs/links for the checklist(s) to me, ideally in one single email.  Do not use eBird&rsquo;s &ldquo;share&rdquo; function to share them with me. (That&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t want to import them into my own personal observation list; I just want to see them.)</p>

<p>If you had any interesting experiences or thoughts about having done this, I would be interested to hear them. But you don&rsquo;t need to send me anything other than the checklist link(s).</p>
