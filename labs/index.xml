      <description>Plan The van is back (they claim), and the birds are at Hempstead Lake SP (hotspot - South End, illustrated histogram).
Expected conditions As of Thursday morning, scattered thunderstorms are forecast for early Friday morning, though rain probability is &amp;lt;50% during lab time. We can manage that. If it rains hard, we will retreat. In a little drizzle, we can probably stay out. At Hempstead, we&amp;rsquo;re never very far from the van.</description>
