<!-- # Identification Resources for North American Birds -->

<!-- <center>([Eliot](http://people.hofstra.edu/Christopher_H_Eliot/home.html), BIO 108/217, Spring 2015)</center> -->

<p>These are resources I think are useful for general/visual bird identification. You might find them helpful either for this class or for your continued learning and field-work.</p>

<h2 id="free-field-guides">Free field guides</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/">All About Birds</a> at Cornell includes accurate information and reliably-identified photos of birds at various ages and plumage-types.</li>
<li>National Audubon Society&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.audubon.org/bird-guide">Guide to North American Birds</a> is another good online guide with both photos and drawings by David Sibley.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-free-resources">Other free resources</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ebird.org/">eBird</a> doesn&rsquo;t offer instructions for identification, but its resources under the Explore Data tab—especially bar-charts and distribution maps—are very useful for assessing what species are most likely at a particular place and date. It is also increasingly integrated with:</li>
<li><a href="https://www.macaulaylibrary.org">Macaulay Library</a> is “the world’s premier scientific archive of natural history audio, video, and photographs.”</li>
<li><a href="http://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/">Merlin</a>, a new app (for <a href="http://bit.ly/MerlinApp">iOS</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/MerlinAndroid">Android</a>) from Cornell leads you through the identification process with questions and images.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.natureinstruct.org/dendroica/">Dendroica</a> is a USGS/Environment Canada-developed module at the NatureInstruct site which is useful for creating free self-quizzes with images and/or vocalizations. It shows its age in terms of web-design, but unique as a free tool. I have a 3-minute screencast about setting up a quiz for yourself <a href="http://people.hofstra.edu/Christopher_H_Eliot/teaching/usingnatureinstruct.mov">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fws.gov/Lab/featheratlas/index.php">USFWS Feather Atlas</a> presents “high-resolution scans of the flight feathers of North American birds,” currently 393 species.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, the well-known photo-sharing  site, offers a lot of good bird images. The number of high-quality images for a species is often huge, and browsing through a lot of images can be useful for learning to recognize birds. But not all images are labeled correctly. That doesn&rsquo;t make them useless, though. Latin-name searches might yield fewer misidentified images?</li>
<li>For articles about the nuances of identification, the archives of <a href="http://www.aba.org/birding/archives.html"><em>Birding</em> magazine</a> from the American Birding Association include some excellent articles on topics like <a href="http://www.aba.org/birding/v36n3p246.pdf">identifying birds in flight</a> and <a href="http://www.aba.org/birding/v40n2p34.pdf">“Field Separation of Sooty and Short-tailed Shearwaters”</a>.</li>
<li>David Sibley&rsquo;s blog, <a href="http://www.sibleyguides.com/">Sibley Guides</a>, has along with other things, some of the best writing and illustration on birds, on topics like <a href="http://www.sibleyguides.com/2012/08/estimating-numbers/">estimating the number of birds in a flock</a> and <a href="http://www.sibleyguides.com/2012/08/identification-of-waterthrushes/">“Identification of Waterthrushes”</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="asking-for-help">Asking for help</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/whatsthisbird/">What&rsquo;s This Bird</a> Facebook group run by the American Birding association invites anyone to post a “picture, video, audio recording, or written description,” and usually someone will suggest an ID within a few minutes. If they&rsquo;re not right, someone who knows better will come along shortly.  (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/whats-this-bird/whats-this-bird/1723470517701667/">Guidelines</a>)</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re welcome to <a href="mailto:Christopher.Eliot@hofstra.edu">email me</a> or tweet at me, at <a href="https://twitter.com/HofstraBirds">@HofstraBirds</a>.</li>
<li>Some people like <a href="http://www.whatbird.com/">WhatBird.com</a>; which I haven&rsquo;t tried. (Let me know what you think, if you do.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sites-and-apps-that-are-not-free">Sites and apps that are not free</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/">Birds of North America Online</a>, the grown-up/professional sibling of <em>All About Birds</em>, BNA was published in print by the American Ornithologists Union (now AOS) until it was converted recently to XML by the Cornell Lab. Access is by subscription, but discounted for students (currently $25/year). It synthesizes the ornithological research literature for each species and presents distinguishing features, distributions, measurements, and natural histories. It&rsquo;s an excellent resource, continually revised, with information that&rsquo;s not elsewhere all in one place.</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sibley-birds-2nd-edition/id1236011411">Sibley Birds 2nd Edition</a> (AKA Sibley Birds V2) is a mobile app version—for five different platforms!—of the book version Sibley Guide. As of today, it&rsquo;s not updated to the Second Edition material. It&rsquo;s what I check if I want to check something in the field. Moreover, it includes several recordings of vocalizations for each species.</li>
<li>Two other apps are <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/peterson-birds-field-guide/id407825684?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink">Peterson Guide to Birds</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibird-pro-guide-to-birds/id308018823?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink">iBird</a>; I don&rsquo;t particularly recommend the former, and I haven&rsquo;t tried the latter.</li>
</ul>
