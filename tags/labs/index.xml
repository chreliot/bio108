      <description>Remember to bring your completed Field Trip Waiver form. You will need it to attend the lab.
Plan Looking ahead, as of Tuesday (Feb 5), the forecast is for warm (and dry enough) for Friday, so it might be a good week to go to the beach. Update to follow later in the week.
Following the recorder rotation list, Penelope will be the recorder, and Selina will help out as the deputy.</description>

      <description>(This page may change.)
We will go on a field trip nearly every Friday morning at 8. Usually we will ride in the van to one or two destinations less than 30 minutes away. We will normally return by 11 AM. Very occasionally, we might cut into class time, which immediately follows.
Preparations in advance  We will need your signed/filled-in permission form before you can go on any trips off campus.</description>
