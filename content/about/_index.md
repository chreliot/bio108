title: Using this site
---

This site is for students in PHI 10 “Introduction to Philosophy” (Spring 2018) at Hofstra University. There are two sites for this course. This site you're reading now presents the reading assignments and related content. Let's  call this “the website.” The other site, the Blackboard site, is available through the password-protected Hofstra Portal. The Blackboard site hosts the syllabus, writing handout, test questions, and writing assignments. Blackboard is also where you submit your writing assignments, and it allows you to access your comments and grades and a few other things. There is a link to Blackboard at the top of this (and every) page.

### Structure of this site

The course involves about ten topic units. There will be a post for each topic, and it will be visible by the end of the previous topic. The topics are all listed on the Home page. They are numbered sequentially (Topic 1, Topic 2, etc.). Each topic post has three sections:

 1. **Reading** - identifies the required reading assignments for the topic and tells you how to find them.
 2. **See also** - lists other sources you might want to look at. These are presented for your interest, not required.
 3. **Afternotes** - lists anything that came up during or after our class discussion.

### Share things

Students regularly send me things they find that are related to our topics, and you can too. I can embed YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, Twitter, and other sources here, and link elsewhere. (Simply avoid offensive, obscene, illegal.)
