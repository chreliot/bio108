<h3 id="what-is-ebird">What is eBird?</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>eBird is the world’s largest biodiversity-related citizen science project, with more than 100 million bird sightings contributed each year by eBirders around the world. A collaborative enterprise with hundreds of partner organizations, thousands of regional experts, and hundreds of thousands of users, eBird is managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. […] eBird data are …  freely accessible to anyone. eBird data have been used in hundreds of conservation decisions and peer-reviewed papers, and [in] thousands of student projects; and [they] help inform bird research worldwide. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="why-are-we-using-ebird">Why are we using eBird?</h3>

<ol>
<li>It makes it easy for us to keep and share records of which species we&rsquo;ve observed on course field trips and where and when we found them.</li>
<li>It will allow you to track what <em>you</em> have observed, both as a subset of the course&rsquo;s list and independently.</li>
<li>It provides an easy, centralized location for us to record and share field notes.</li>
<li>It will focus some of our attention on counting and estimating numbers.</li>
<li>In sharing our observations there, we will contribute to the best bird-distribution and abundance data set.</li>
<li>As we will access information from that data set repeatedly during the class, it will be valuable for you to understand its assumptions and the details of how it&rsquo;s produced.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-do-i-need-to-do-to-get-started">What do I need to do to get started?</h3>

<ol>
<li>Create an eBird account as soon as you can after our first lab.</li>
<li>Tell me your eBird username by Wednesday, Feb 6.</li>
<li>Optionally, consider browsing the eBird site a bit to see what&rsquo;s there.</li>
<li>Optionally, consider downloading the &ldquo;eBird by Cornell Lab&rdquo; mobile app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ebird/id988799279?mt=8">for iOS</a> from Apple App Store, or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cornell.birds.ebird&amp;hl=en_US">for Android</a> from the Google Play store, and set it up with your eBird account.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="when-will-i-use-ebird">When will I use eBird?</h3>

<p>For labs, you will use it in two ways: (1) contributing to lab checklists (instructions <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/posts/field-trip-instructions/#what-do-i-need-to-do-for-labs">here</a>), and (2) recording the results of your 90 minutes of independent observation (instructions <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/posts/independent-observation-assignment/">here</a>).</p>

<h3 id="more-information">More information?</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s lots of useful advice at <a href="https://help.ebird.org">eBird help</a>, or ask me!</p>
