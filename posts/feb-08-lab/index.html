<p><em>Remember to bring your completed Field Trip Waiver form. You will need it to attend the lab.</em></p>

<p><em>Please sign up for an eBird account soon (see <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/posts/using-ebird/">Using eBird</a>), so we can share the lab checklist with you.</em></p>

<h3 id="plan">Plan</h3>

<p>We will go to the west end of Jones Beach State Park. Our planned first stop will be for a walk through the dunes and beach at <a href="https://ebird.org/hotspot/L109147">Jones Beach SP&ndash;West End</a>, looking at the dunes, the beach, the ocean, and Jones Inlet. We may do the two-mile loop around the point. Then, time allowing, we&rsquo;ll do a second, more stationary stop at <a href="https://ebird.org/hotspot/L109146">Jones Beach SP&ndash;Coast Guard Station</a>, observing the more-protected Jones Bay, bay beach, and grass/shrubs. We will try to catch birds pushed up by the 9:32 AM high tide.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/posts/recorder-rotation/">recorder rotation</a> list, Penelope will be the recorder, and Selina will help out as the deputy.</p>

<p>Target species include waterfowl (order Anseriformes, family Anatidae) across many subfamilies and genera, with an emphasis on sea and bay-favoring species: loons (Common Loon and Red-throated Loon), scoters (3 species), Common Eider, diving ducks (Bufflehead, Greater Scaup, et al.), mergansers (Red-breasted Merganser, possibly others), geese (Canada Goose, Brant), dabbling ducks (American Black Duck, Mallard), Long-tailed Duck, Harlequin Duck); Dunlin and Sanderling; possible raptors (especially Northern Harrier and Cooper&rsquo;s Hawk); gulls; wintering passerines including Yellow-rumped Warbler, Horned Lark, Red-breasted Nuthatch. And possibly other goodies!</p>

<h3 id="expected-conditions">Expected conditions</h3>

<p>Wind and possible, occasional rain. Deep sand that may be wet, maybe puddles to try to tiptoe around. It will be relatively warm for February on the barrier beaches, but we&rsquo;ll need to prepare for strong wind and drizzle that could make it feel cold.</p>

<p>Check the <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/us/ny/point-lookout">weather forecast for Point Lookout station</a>.</p>

<h3 id="special-instructions">Special instructions</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you have binoculars, please bring them.</li>
<li>Ideally, bring multiple warm layers with a raincoat/rain-shell on the outside (and optionally, consider bring your backpack or similar so you can shed any unnecessary layers)?</li>
<li>Unlike other labs, you can always bring water, snacks, coffee with you!</li>
</ul>
