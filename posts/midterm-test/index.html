<p>The midterm test on <strong>March 15</strong> has four parts.</p>

<h3 id="parts-of-the-test">Parts of the test</h3>

<p>The first part will ask you to label the names of parts of birds. The parts you may need to use are listed below. You may be given images (drawn <em>or</em> photographed) of a Passerine/perching bird (like on page xvi) or a duck <del>or a hawk</del>. Those are the groups we&rsquo;ve spent time looking at. The birds in the images may be perched or in flight. To study, start with pages xvi to xxii in Sibley.</p>

<p>The second part will ask you to name four structural features that are distinctive of the bird shown. It will be a species that you haven&rsquo;t seen yet. You should write structural features&mdash;those <em>not</em> having to do with color&mdash;that could help pin an identification on this unidentified bird. In other words, not something like &ldquo;bill size&rdquo; but rather something like &ldquo;The bill is about one and a half times the length of its head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third part will be a brief video of a bird in flight. It will ask you to comment on the posture and/or movement of the bird shown, such as might help identify it. As much as possible, use vocabulary we learned in class.</p>

<p>The fourth part will be an extended version of your weekly quizzes, except that any and all of the <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/posts/learned-species/">species we have learned so far</a> may be on the slides. They may appear more than once, and they may not appear at all.</p>

<h3 id="relative-weight">Relative weight</h3>

<p>The first part will be worth 20% of the test grade. The second and third parts will each be worth 10% of the test grade. The fourth part will be worth 60% of the test grade.</p>

<p>Please feel free to be in touch if you have any questions about this.  Remember that beyond your notes from class and the Sibley guide you purchased, you can also use other resources to study, including those listed on the <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/posts/online-identification-resources/">identification resources page</a>. I hope your studying goes well!</p>

<li id="fn:1">Just FYI, tertials are also called “tertial flight feathers,” and similarly with secondary flight feathers and primary flight feathers. And all the flight feathers on the wings are also called “remiges.” But you may use the shorter words listed above.
