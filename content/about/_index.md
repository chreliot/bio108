title: Using this site
---

This site is for students in Bio 108 and 217 “Ornithology” (Spring 2019) at Hofstra University. It's for my (Eliot's) Friday and lab sections of the course.

In addition to this site, I also use the course's Blackboard site, which is available through the password-protected Hofstra Portal. The reason to put content in both places is that this site is easy for you to access and for me to publish to, while the Blackboard site is good for hosting password-protected information like grades. There is a link to Blackboard at the top of this (and every) page.
