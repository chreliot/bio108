<h3 id="task">Task</h3>

<p>Observe birds independently for a cumulative 80 minutes minimum (BIO 217 students) or 60 minutes (BIO 108 students). Submit an eBird checklist (or checklists) documenting what you found and send me the URL for the list(s).</p>

<h3 id="due">Due</h3>

<p>Email links to your checklist(s) to me by <strong>Monday May 13</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>

<p>Sometime during the semester, or several times, you should observe and count birds on your own outside of class for a combined minimum of 80 minutes.  It can be one continuous count, or as many as eight  different times and places. You can use eBird&rsquo;s stationary or traveling protocols, and you can be anywhere outdoorsâ€”hiking in the woods, or sitting on a bench at Hofstra, or visiting a city park, or wherever you like. One rewarding strategy is to visit the same place several times, weeks apart, and noting differences. I would just urge you to choose a place that will be enjoyable and interesting for you, as the goal is learning and experience, not busy-work.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re done, add the observations to eBird checklists. Use counts rather than X&rsquo;s. Then email URLs/links for the checklist(s) to me, ideally in one single email.  Do not use eBird&rsquo;s &ldquo;share&rdquo; function to share them with me. (That&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t want to import them into my own personal observation list; I just want to see them.)</p>

<p>If you had any interesting experiences or thoughts about having done this, I would be interested to hear them. But you don&rsquo;t need to send me anything other than the checklist link(s).</p>
