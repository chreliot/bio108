<p>Here&rsquo;s what you will need for the course:</p>

<h3 id="book">Book</h3>

<p>The identification guide you need for this course is: <em>The Sibley Guide to Birds</em>, 2nd edition (2014), by David Allen Sibley, published Alfred A. Knopf. ISBN: 9780307957900 (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/964454243">Worldcat</a>)
.</p>

<p>You may want to bring the book to class; it&rsquo;s optional. You do not need to bring the book to labs.</p>

<h3 id="binoculars-yours-or-ours">Binoculars (yours or ours)</h3>

<p>If you already have binoculars or can borrow some from someone for the duration of the course, they will be useful. If you don&rsquo;t, the Biology department and I each have a few pairs we can loan each Friday. If you plan to use ours, it would help us to know about that as soon as possible, because it is probably  possible for Biology to buy more.</p>

<p>Binoculars have lots of applications other than bird-observation, within and beyond biology, though they can be quite expensive, and buying therefore not a possibility for many students. But if you <em>are</em> interested in buying binoculars, I will offer some thoughts on the first day.  Here are some ratings:</p>

<li><a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-binoculars/">The Wirecutter&rsquo;s 2018 ratings</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="clothes">Clothes</h3>

<p>The lab consists mostly of field trips, and almost every week we will be going where birds are, including open and windy places. So, you will need to have clothes that keep you comfortable in those kinds of places.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cold weather</strong>: <em>multiple layers</em> of warm clothes, including warm inner layers like wool, wind-resistant outer layers, gloves, warm hat, and a  scarf or neck-gaiter;</li>
<li><strong>Warm weather</strong>: a raincoat or similar way to stay dry in at least a drizzle, and shoes or boots that can get a little muddy or sandy (and possibly a little wet). Optionally, a sun hat.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The cold conditions we expect to encounter a few times in this course can be dangerous.</em> Out on Jones Beach  at 8:30 AM in February, standing still in a misty, brisk wind scanning for off-shore birds, you almost can&rsquo;t be too bundled up. We may face windchills below 10Â°F for more than two hours. You&rsquo;re going to want a lot of layers which aren&rsquo;t cotton, and ways to keep your hands and head and face warm to a degree you don&rsquo;t have to deal with in normal life. It&rsquo;s easy to be dangerously unprepared, and you should plan ahead. Plan to ignore fashion. Borrow layers. I may be able to bring  layers I can share. I want you to be able to observe birds safely and comfortably.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t need to be fancy. Can be fancy. Useful if it fits in a pocket.</p>
