      <description>What is eBird?  eBird is the world’s largest biodiversity-related citizen science project, with more than 100 million bird sightings contributed each year by eBirders around the world. A collaborative enterprise with hundreds of partner organizations, thousands of regional experts, and hundreds of thousands of users, eBird is managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. […] eBird data are … freely accessible to anyone. eBird data have been used in hundreds of conservation decisions and peer-reviewed papers, and [in] thousands of student projects; and [they] help inform bird research worldwide.</description>

      <description>([Eliot](http://people.hofstra.edu/Christopher_H_Eliot/home.html), BIO 108/217, Spring 2015) -- These are resources I think are useful for general/visual bird identification. You might find them helpful either for this class or for your continued learning and field-work.
Free field guides  All About Birds at Cornell includes accurate information and reliably-identified photos of birds at various ages and plumage-types. National Audubon Society&amp;rsquo;s Guide to North American Birds is another good online guide with both photos and drawings by David Sibley.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s quite recent that some excellent bird-identification materials have moved online. Ten years ago there was approximately nothing. Now there are some very good ones. Still, much of the best and most useful information is available only in books. You won&amp;rsquo;t need these for the course, but you may want to learn more than what we cover in the course.
So, besides your Big Sibley, some of the books I value most are:</description>

      <description>(This page may change.)
We will go on a field trip nearly every Friday morning at 8. Usually we will ride in the van to one or two destinations less than 30 minutes away. We will normally return by 11 AM.
Preparations in advance  We will need your signed/filled-in permission form before you can go on any trips off campus. Seriously, plan to be able to dress for dangerous weather.</description>

      <title>Optional Materials</title>

      <description>The following are not in any way required. Just, you might value these things if you have them available:
Sunglasses If you have sunglasses that you can see well through, they can help keep your eyes relaxed and happy while staring into bright and variable light, sometimes in the wind. And your eyes are your main tool for labs.
Microfiber cloth Especially if you wear glasses, but also for your binoculars, being able to wipe off smudges can noticeably improve your experience of watching things carefully outdoors.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s what you will need for the course:
Book The identification guide you need for this course is: The Sibley Guide to Birds, 2nd edition (2014), by David Allen Sibley, published Alfred A. Knopf. ISBN: 9780307957900 (Worldcat) .
You may want to bring the book to class; it&amp;rsquo;s optional. You do not need to bring the book to labs.
Binoculars (yours or ours) If you have binoculars or can borrow some from someone for the duration of the course, that will help.</description>
