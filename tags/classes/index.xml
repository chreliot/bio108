      <description>We began with a bit of history, noting the emergence of field-recognition techniques and contrast between the “field marks” and GISS or BBI approaches. Then we focused how to pay attention to and talk about size, shape, and structure, including relative size and proportions.
Learning species (for quiz next week) These were the species for which we carefully examined differences.
 Downy Woodpecker Hairy Woodpecker Common Loon Red-throated Loon  Also on the quiz Shown an image of a perched bird: “Make a short list of at least four structural features of this bird that might be helpful in identifying it.</description>

-- We will meet in our Friday classroom, which is different from both your Monday classroom and our Friday lab space. It is 103 Brower (campus map location).
Learning species (for quiz next week)  American Robin Northern Mockingbird  Also, learn the vocabulary terms on the distributed sheet, to be able to recognize where they go on a picture of a bird. You can use the bird topography diagrams in your Sibley book to study this (and you can find alternative diagrams online).</description>
