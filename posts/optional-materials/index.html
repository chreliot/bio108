<p>The following are <strong>not in any way required</strong>. Just, you might value these things if you have them available:</p>

<h3 id="sunglasses">Sunglasses</h3>

<p>If you have sunglasses that you can see well through, they can help keep your eyes relaxed and happy while staring into bright and variable light, sometimes in the wind. And your eyes are your main tool for labs.</p>

<h3 id="microfiber-cloth">Microfiber cloth</h3>

<p>Especially if you wear glasses, but also for your binoculars, being able to wipe off smudges can noticeably improve your experience of watching things carefully outdoors.</p>

<h3 id="grippy-gloves-or-glove-liners">Grippy gloves or glove liners</h3>

<p>If you need to use a pen or focus binoculars or do data entry on your phone, your puffy snowboarding mitts (or whatever) might need to come off. It would help to have thought in advance about a strategy for using your hands in the field.</p>

<h3 id="camera">Camera</h3>

<p>To save images of what you see, you would need either a “superzoom” compact camera or an interchangeable-lens camera with a long lens (e.g., &gt;200 mm for DSLR, or &gt;100mm for smaller sensors like Micro Four-Thirds systems). If you capture photos of birds, you can upload them to our eBird checklists (<a href="https://help.ebird.org/customer/portal/articles/973966-adding-photos-videos-and-recordings-to-checklists">instructions here</a>).</p>
