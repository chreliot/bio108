<p>(<em>This page may change.</em>)</p>

<p>We will go on a field trip nearly every Friday morning at 8. Usually we will ride in the van to one or two destinations less than 30 minutes away. We will normally return by 11 AM.</p>

<h3 id="preparations-in-advance">Preparations in advance</h3>

<ol>
<li>We will need your signed/filled-in permission form before you can go on any trips off campus.</li>
<li>Seriously, plan to be able to dress for dangerous  weather. (See the <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/posts/required-materials/#clothes">Clothes</a> note.)</li>
<li>Bring: a notebook and a pen and binoculars if you have them. We can lock other belongings in the van. You don&rsquo;t need to bring your bird guide, though you mayâ€”you might want to review in the van what you&rsquo;ve just seen, for example.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="meeting-and-departure">Meeting and departure</h3>

<ol>
<li>We will meet at/outside the Biology lounge on the first floor of Gittleson Hall a little before 8 AM on Fridays. I will normally have the van parked outside.</li>
<li>We will board the van and leave Hofstra within a few minutes of 8 AM, even if some students are missing.</li>
<li>I realize it&rsquo;s not always possible, but when you&rsquo;ll be absent, it would be useful if you would send me a brief email or text alerting me that you won&rsquo;t be there. (I won&rsquo;t be judge-y about the reason! If you overslept, it&rsquo;s still useful to know you won&rsquo;t be coming.)</li>
<li>I will post the plans for each trip on this site. Look at the home page, or visit the <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/tags/labs/">labs</a> page/button.</li>
<li>When <strong>bad weather</strong> strikes, plans can change quickly. Icy roads will cancel our driving anywhere, and ran more than a drizzle can make observing birds overly difficult.  So: first check for updates on the <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/tags/labs/">lab</a> page for the day and your Hostra email. But I can&rsquo;t update the site  while traveling, and conditions can change quickly. So, for last minute updates, I&rsquo;ll use these back-up channels: (1) the @HofstraBirds Twitter page, and (2) email, if I can get to it. If you can&rsquo;t figure out what&rsquo;s going on, you may also text me.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-do-i-need-to-do-for-labs">What do I need to do for labs?</h3>

<p>For each lab, one student will be designated <strong>recorder</strong> and one student will be the  <strong>deputy</strong>. The recorder is the primary data collector; they record what the group observes and submit the eBird list of record. The deputy helps the recorder make sure the group list is complete.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong> Your task is to help find birds, observe them carefully, communicate to the recorder or deputy any observations and counts they might have missed, and make some observation-notes in a notebook. Your notes can be about bird appearances and distinguishing features, how related species were ruled out, observed behaviors, and/or habitats. When you accept the eBird list to your account, add at least one note to the comments section of an observation.</p>

<p>The requirements for your checklist note are: It should begin with your initials and a colon (like &ldquo;CE:&rdquo; so we can recognize it&rsquo;s yours). It should be at least two sentences; it doesn&rsquo;t need to be longer than that. It should not duplicate the information in someone else&rsquo;s note(s). And it should be added to the eBird list within a week, before the next lab.</p>

<p><strong>Recorder:</strong> If you are the recorder for the week, your job is to accurately record the group&rsquo;s observations in real time, using a notebook or the eBird mobile app. Each location should have its own checklist, so you might need to create two or three. You should work with the deputy to make sure your lists are complete and accurate. The lists should have accurate start and stop times, locations/hotspots, and distances traveled. After the lab, you should submit the checklist to eBird and then as soon as possible (and definitely within 24 hours) share it with me (user eliotc). I will share it with everyone else.</p>

<p><strong>Deputy:</strong> If you are the deputy for the week, your job is to help the recorder compile an accurate list. Like, as we&rsquo;re walking, &ldquo;Did you get those three ibises?&rdquo; Then, review the list with them afterwards.</p>
