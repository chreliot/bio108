<p>The second test/final exam will be on <strong>May 17</strong> 10:30–12:30 in our Brower classroom.</p>

<h3 id="test-content">Test content</h3>

<p>The second test will consist entirely of identifications. You will just need to write the exact English names (including punctuation and capitalization patterns) of <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/posts/learned-species/">species we learned</a>. In other words, the structure will be just like our usual quizzes, with one small variation. Some—a minority of—the species will be presented in video rather than in photos. The video identifications will count exactly the same as the photo identifications. Species may appear on the test more than once (but not exactly the same images, because who would ever do that).</p>

<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>

<p>The test will not take the whole two hours, and no bathroom breaks (or otherwise leaving the room) will be permitted during the test. I will ask you not to talk about what you&rsquo;re seeing until the test is over.</p>

<h3 id="and">And …</h3>

<p>Please feel free to be in touch if you have any questions about the test.  Remember that in addition your notes from class and the Sibley identification guide you purchased, you can also use many other resources to study, including those listed on the <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/posts/online-identification-resources/">identification resources page</a>. I hope your studying goes well!</p>
