      <description>Each week after lab, unless you are the week&amp;rsquo;s recorder or deputy, your assignment is to post a note on the group checklist (or one of the group&amp;rsquo;s checklists; sometimes there will be more than one). This is due within a week, before the next lab.
Set up (you only need to do this once) Create an eBird account as soon as you can after our first lab. Go to the eBird main page at https://ebird.</description>

      <description>What is eBird?  eBird is the world’s largest biodiversity-related citizen science project, with more than 100 million bird sightings contributed each year by eBirders around the world. A collaborative enterprise with hundreds of partner organizations, thousands of regional experts, and hundreds of thousands of users, eBird is managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. […] eBird data are … freely accessible to anyone. eBird data have been used in hundreds of conservation decisions and peer-reviewed papers, and [in] thousands of student projects; and [they] help inform bird research worldwide.</description>

      <title>Field Trip Instructions</title>
      <link>http://chreliot.github.io/bio108/posts/field-trip-instructions/</link>

      <description>We will go on a field trip nearly every Friday morning at 8. Usually we will ride in the van to one or two destinations less than 30 minutes from Hofstra. We will normally return by 11 AM. Very occasionally, we might cut into class time, which immediately follows.
Preparations in advance  We will need your signed/filled-in permission form before you can go on any trips off campus. Seriously, plan to be able to dress—just a few times—for very cold conditions.</description>

      <title>Optional Materials</title>

      <description>The following are not in any way required. Just, you might value these things if you have them available:
Sunglasses If you have sunglasses that you can see well through, they can help keep your eyes relaxed and happy while staring into bright and variable light, sometimes in the wind. And your eyes are your main tool for labs.
Microfiber cloth Especially if you wear glasses, but also for your binoculars, being able to wipe off smudges can noticeably improve your experience of watching things carefully outdoors.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s what you will need for the course:
Book The identification guide you need for this course is: The Sibley Guide to Birds, 2nd edition (2014), by David Allen Sibley, published Alfred A. Knopf. ISBN: 9780307957900 (Worldcat) .
You may want to bring the book to class; it&amp;rsquo;s optional. You do not need to bring the book to labs.
Binoculars (yours or ours) If you already have binoculars or can borrow some from someone for the duration of the course, they will be useful.</description>
