      <description>Each week after lab, unless you are the week&amp;rsquo;s recorder or deputy, your assignment is to post a note on the group checklist (or one of the group&amp;rsquo;s checklists; sometimes there will be more than one). This is due within a week, before the next lab.
Set up (you only need to do this once) Create an eBird account as soon as you can after our first lab. Go to the eBird main page at https://ebird.</description>
