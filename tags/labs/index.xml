      <description>Plan Introductory presentation in our lab space, Gittleson 323. Then, outdoor walk around Hofstra campus to look for birds for up to 90 minutes. (Update on Thursday evening: I am now hedging about going outside, or at least going out for so long because it will probably be much colder than I had expected. Let&amp;#39;s make a group decision in the morning.  )
Special instructions If you have binoculars, please bring them.</description>

      <description>(This page may change.)
We will go on a field trip nearly every Friday morning at 8. Usually we will ride in the van to one or two destinations less than 30 minutes away. We will normally return by 11 AM. Very occasionally, we might cut into class time, which immediately follows.
Preparations in advance  We will need your signed/filled-in permission form before you can go on any trips off campus.</description>
